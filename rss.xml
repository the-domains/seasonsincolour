            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Live louder</h1><p>It doesn't get louder than having your tea in a toilet wrapped in eyeballs while holding your cat bearing tea cup wearing red latex gloves. Say what?!! Welcome to the new world of IKEA with GILTIG, their newest collection launching this week. Although the collection, designed by menswear designer Katie Eary, had been announced last year, the time has come and it's here! I checked Croydon's store and, yes, I could pop in tomorrow and get anything I want! If you like what you see, you need to hurry! This is a Limited Edition available for a few weeks only. Be ready to have your boundaries pushed to the limit. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/67258c345878cf6b970fe27919932a9f04491163.png"></article>]]></description>
